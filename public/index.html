        <h1>You Selected a Green Pill, You Are Safe</h1>
        <p>By selecting the green pill, you've taken a symbolic step towards safety and awareness. While you are 'safe'
            in this scenario, it's important to understand the broader context of benzodiazepine prescriptions and their
            impacts.</p>

                <p>Those that have been given the ‘white pill’ (injured by benzodiazepines) are often left to their own
                    devices, instead of receiving the proper medical and social support that’s needed.</p>
                <p>Through TOXSICK we want to advocate for awareness that leads to real-world change, so that those who
                    have been injured can be properly supported, and that we can all live in a world where we can trust
                    our medical systems.</p>
